      "\n",
      "We're excited to release an experimental version of Flux Control fine-tuning scripts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Flux Control from\n",
      "Black Forest Labs\n",
      ", is, by far, the strongest alternative to ControlNets while being computationally far more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of Flux Control is simple yet elegant:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Instead of maintaining a separate auxiliary module like ControlNet or T2I Adapter, increase the number of input channels for the image latents in the pretrained Flux DiT. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Compute the latents of the structural inputs (depth map, for example) with the VAE and concatenate it with the actual latents you started the denoising process with.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. During training, only the original image latents are noised and the structural latents are then concatenated to it before it's fed to the denoiser. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. We start from the pretrained T2I Flux DiT along with the additional channels and train further on a similar ControlNet-like dataset!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, no auxiliary models are trained here. \n",
      "\n",
      "During inference, only a single model is invoked in the iterative denoising process (typically as opposed to the auxiliary module and the denoiser, as seen in ControlNets).\n",
      "\n",
      "We're releasing both LoRA and non-LoRA versions of the training script for this release. Both scripts have DeepSpeed (Zero2) compatibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "In our experiments, full fine-tuning is more effective than the LoRA variant, which makes sense because of the difficulty of the problem space. Happy to be proven wrong!\n",
